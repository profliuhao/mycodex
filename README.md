# CodeX Showcase Playground

This repository is a landing page + mini-game sandbox for CodeX demos. The first
showcase is an HTML5 helicopter runner game.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple dev server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000.

## Controls

- **Spacebar**, **mouse**, or **touch** to add lift.
- Avoid the towers to keep flying.
- Each cleared gap adds a point.
